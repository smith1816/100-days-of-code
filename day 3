#concatenate two strings in Python
    Python string is a collection of Unicode characters. Python provides many built-in functions for string manipulation. String concatenation is a process when one string is merged with another string. It can be done in the following ways.

Using + operators
Using join() method
Using % method
Using format() function


#program
# Python program to show  
# string concatenation  
  
# Defining strings  
str1="smith"
str2="pandya"
str3=str1 + str2
print(str3)


# Python program to  
# string concatenation  
  
str1 = "Hello"  
str2 = "JavaTpoint"  
  
# join() method is used to combine the strings  
print("".join([str1, str2]))  
  
# join() method is used to combine  
# the string with a separator Space(" ")  
str3 = " ".join([str1, str2])  
  
print(str3)
